/// oka owns compile/sync and process lifecycle; the MCP toolkit is the

/// the bridge: [AndroidAppTarget] starts `oka dev` — the owning session that

/// ([flutter_mcp_harness](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mcp_harness)) a
/// [LaunchedApp] wired to the forwarded VM service URI published in
/// `.flutter_mcp/runner-session.json`.
///
/// Scenarios then drive/assert with `WidgetDriver`/`Scenario` exactly like
/// desktop targets do; `example/` shows the composition root.
